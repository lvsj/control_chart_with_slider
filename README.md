* [v1: Slider cannot change Piechart ](https://github.com/lvsj/control_chart_with_slider_v1),In this demo, slider cannot control piechart, figure out how to complete the control  function base on it.

* [v2: change chart using global variable](https://github.com/lvsj/control_chart_with_slider_v2), The way of rebuilding piechart in this demo is what Matt Sullivan used in the video.  **Attention:**    This demo is just to provide a bad solution that using global varibale rebuild piechart widget, not recommended in real project.
